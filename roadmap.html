                <h3>Atomic Habits</h3>
                <p> No matter your goals, Atomic Habits offers a proven framework for improving--every day. 
                    James Clear, one of the world's leading experts on habit formation, reveals practical 
                    strategies that will teach you exactly how to form good habits, break bad ones, 
                    and master the tiny behaviors that lead to remarkable results. If you're having 
                    trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. 
                    Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change,
                    but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of 
                    your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system 
                    that can take you to new heights.

                <h3>Introduction to Mathematical Thinking</h3>
                <p>Mathematical thinking is not the same as doing mathematics 
                    – at least not as mathematics is typically presented in our 
                    school system. School math typically focuses on learning 
                    procedures to solve highly stereotyped problems. Professional 
                    mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, 
                    problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, 
                    or from within mathematics itself. The key to success in school math 
                    is to learn to think inside-the-box. In contrast, a key feature of 
                    mathematical thinking is thinking outside-the-box – a valuable ability 
                    in today’s world. This course helps to develop that crucial way of thinking.

                <h3>Introduction to Computer Science (CS50)</h3>
                <p>This course teaches students how to think algorithmically 
                    and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, 
                    algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, 
                    security, and software engineering. Languages include C, Python, 
                    and SQL plus students choice of: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
                    (for web development); Java or Swift (for mobile app development); 
                    or Lua (for game development).

                <h3>Programming in Python</h3>
                <p> 6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python is intended 
                    for students with little or no programming experience. It aims to provide 
                    students with an understanding of the role computation can play in solving 
                    problems and to help students, regardless of their major, feel justifiably 
                    confident of their ability to write small programs that allow them to accomplish 
                    useful goals. The class uses the Python 3.5 programming language.

                <h3>Algorithms, Part I</h3>
                <p> This course covers the essential information that every serious programmer 
                    needs to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on 
                    applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. 
                    Part I covers elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms. 
                    Part II focuses on graph- and string-processing algorithms.
